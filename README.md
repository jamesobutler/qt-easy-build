# Frequently Asked Questions

**Why does the windows build stop with "The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a receive." ?**

As explained [here](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/Installation#installing-with-restricted-tls), this most likely happens because the build script is attempting to download from a server that needs to use TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2 (has restricted the use of TLS 1.0 and SSL v3).

To address the problem, you should update the version of `.NET` installed and install a newer version of PowerShell:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework_version_history#Overview
* https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/21016.how-to-install-windows-powershell-4-0.aspx

**Why does the linux build stop with `curl: (35) SSL connect error`?**

TLS auto-negotation may fail on older Linux versions. Try adding `--tlsv1.2` to the `curl` invocations in `Build-qt.sh`.
